This game is to relax and chill. Here you have to slash your enemies. Do it! Test your skill!
So, here you have to destroy your enemies. You have a ship (it's you) and unlimited ammunition. At the very top of the screen, enemies are falling on you. By pressing the "SPACEBAR", you open fire. On the insoles you can move left and right. Your task is to destroy a given number of enemies. There is no timer. There is also a skip counter. Have a good game!
